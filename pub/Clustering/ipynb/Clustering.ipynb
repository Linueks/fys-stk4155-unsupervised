    "# Clustering Analysis\n",
    "In this chapter we will concern ourselves with the study of **cluster analysis**.\n",
    "In general terms cluster analysis, or clustering, is the task of grouping a\n",
    "data-set into different distinct categories based on some measure of equality of\n",
    "the data. This measure is often referred to as a **metric** or **similarity\n",
    "measure** in the literature (note: sometimes we deal with a **dissimilarity\n",
    "measure** instead). Usually, these metrics are formulated as some kind of\n",
    "distance function between points in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a lot of such distance measures. The simplest, and also the most\n",
    "common is the **Euclidean distance** (i.e. Pythagoras). A good source for those of\n",
    "you wanting a thorough overview is the article (DOI:10.5120/ijca2016907841\n",
    "Irani, Pise, Phatak). A few other metrics mentioned there are: *cosine\n",
    "similarity*, *Manhattan distance*, *Chebychev distance* and the *Minkowski\n",
    "distance*. The Minkowski distance is a general formulation which encapsulates a\n",
    "range of metrics. All of these, and many more, can be used in clustering. There\n",
    "exists different categories of clustering algorithms. A few of the most\n",
    "common are: *centroid-*, *distribution-*, *density-* and *hierarchical-\n",
    "clustering*. We will concern ourselves primarily with the first one."

    "## Basic Idea of the K-means Clustering Algorithm\n",
    "The simplest of all clustering algorithms is the aptly named **k-means algorithm**\n",
    ", sometimes also referred to as *Lloyds algorithm*. It is the simplest and also\n",
    "the most common. From its simplicity it obtains both strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "These will be discussed in more detail later. The k-means algorithm is a\n",
    "**centroid based** clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume, we are given $n$ data points and we wish to split the data into $K < n$\n",
    "different categories, or clusters. We label each cluster by an integer $k\\in\\{\n",
    "1, \\cdots, K \\}$. In the basic k-means algorithm each point is assigned to only\n",
    "one cluster $k$, and these assignments are *non-injective* i.e. many-to-one. We\n",
    "can think of these mappings as an encoder $k = C(i)$, which assigns the $i$-th\n",
    "data-point $\\bf x_i$ to the $k$-th cluster. Before we jump into the mathematics\n",
    "let us describe the k-means algorithm in words:\n",
    "1. We start with guesses / random initializations of our $k$ cluster centers / centroids\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each centroid the points that are most similar are identified\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then we move / replace each centroid with a coordinate average of all the points that were assigned to that centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Iterate this points 2, 3) until the centroids no longer move (to some tolerance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we consider the method formally. Again, we assume we have $n$ data-points\n",
    "(vectors)"

    "\n",
